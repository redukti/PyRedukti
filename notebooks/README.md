## Example OpenRedukti Jupyter Notebooks

Just click on them - GitHub is able to display the contents!

You can also run a docker session and play with the notebooks. Assuming you have Docker installed, just try:

```
docker run --rm -it -p 8888:8888/tcp redukti-ubuntu-pyredukti:latest
```

Copy/paste the URL Jupyter tells you - you may need to fix the hostname. You should see the examples in a /Samples folder.
